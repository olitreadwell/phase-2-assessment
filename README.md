# Student Organization Management Application
By now you should be familiar with basic sinatra apps and creating simple websites.  This problem will give you a chance to demonstrate your proficiency with the web by writing code for controllers, authentication, views, and basic HTML forms with a little bit of CSS. We're going full [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) and building a student oranization management application.

The problem is broken into 4 parts.  You will need to complete each part to move on. We've given approximate timing for each part.  If you find you are taking a lot longer be sure to ask questions.

## Objectives

### Part 1: Authentication (Timing ~ 30 min)

Authentication is a central concern of most web applications.  We're going to start by creating a simple app that does nothing more than authenticate a student.


#### Student Model

You have an empty `Student` model and a database with a `students` table.  Add validations to the `Student` model which guarantee the following:

1. Every student has an email
2. Every student's email is unique
3. Every email looks like `* @ *.*`
4. Every student has a password

You should not store the student's password directly in the database.

#### Sign Up, Log In, Log Out

Create views to allow a student to:

1. Sign up as a new student
2. Log in as an existing student
3. Log out as an existing student

### Part 2: Organizations  (Timing ~ 30 min)
We have students and organizations.
* Students can be members of many organizations.
* Organizations need leadership, so an organization belongs to president.

#### Associations

We've already defined the three models for you.  You'll need to create the associations between them.

The `Student` model should have:

1. `student.presidencies` should return the list of organization led by the student
2. `student.organizations` should return the list of organization the student is a member, but not a leader

To be clear, `presidencies` and `organizations` should return completely different results.

The `Organization` model should have:

1. `organization.president` should return the student that is leading the organization
2. `organization.members` should return a list of members

To help you along your way, we recommend reviewing the ActiveRecord documentation, specifically the available options for the association methods you'll be using.

**Note**: Before you move on to Part 3, be sure your associations are working as expected. Try `rake console` for testing.

Once your associations have been set up, you should be able to run `bundle exec rake db:seed` without any errors.  This will populate the data for you.

### Part 3: CRUD It Up (Timing ~ 45 min)

With student authentication in place it's time to add the functionality needed to manage organizations. As a user to the application, you must be able to do the following:

#### Minimum

* View all organizations
* View a single organization; the organization page should look similar to the [mockup](mockup.png)
* Create a new organization
* Delete an organization

#### Stretch

* Edit

### Part 4: AJAXify it (Timing ~ 30 min)
On the page that lists all the organizations, add the form for creating a new organization.  Use AJAX on this form so that when a student adds a new organization, that new organization is appended to the list of organization without refreshing the page.
